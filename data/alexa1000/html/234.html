They also have the bonus effect of making the wearer look like Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man.\n\nFederico Parietti, a Ph.D. candidate, and Harry Asada, an engineering professor, both work at MIT's d'Arbeloff Laboratory for Information Systems and Technology. The team presented their robot concept at this year's International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Hong Kong on June 2, and the project has been getting major buzz ever since. \n\nSee also: 14 Robotics Breakthroughs From the Past Decade\n\nThe goal of the limbs is to physically support workers and to get projects done more quickly. The movements are controlled by motor-powered joints that can move along with the user's actual arms and legs. Previous extremities were created to replace missing limbs, whereas these are intended to supplement existing ones.\n\nThe limbs sit at the user's waist and are attached by straps that hook over the shoulders like a backpack. They are intended to be used as either arms or legs, according to a summary on the lab's website. \n\nWhile science is still a long way off to inventing arms that can move using the mind -- just like Doc Ock's do -- the creation is a step forward in robotic technology. \n\nBelow is a video shown at the conference demonstrating how the limbs work.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

The brief report said he chose the North \"as a shelter.\"\n\nNorth Korea also has been holding a Korean-American missionary, Kenneth Bae, since November 2012. Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what the North says were hostile acts against the state.\n\nNorth Korea has been pushing to promote tourism as part of efforts to earn badly needed foreign currency, but the country is also extremely sensitive about how visitors act while in the country.\n\nFriday's announcement came as tension on the Korean Peninsula remains high with North Korea keeping up rhetoric against the U.S. and South Korea following its series of missile and rocket launches earlier this year. The North's state media have also unleashed racist and sexist slurs against U.S. and South Korean leaders.\n\nThe peninsula is still in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea.\n\nThe U.S. and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations, but Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, oversees consular issues for the United States there. Unless a detainee signs a privacy waiver, the State Department cannot give details about the case.\n\nIn March, North Korea deported an Australian missionary detained for spreading Christianity in the country after he apologized for anti-state religious acts and requested forgiveness.\n\nIn December, North Korea released 85-year-old American veteran of the Korean War, Merrill Newman, who was held for several weeks after traveling to North Korea as a tourist. Newman was freed after he gave a videotaped confession in which he apologized for killing North Koreans during the war. Newman later said the confession was given involuntarily and under duress."},"shares":{"twitter":41,"facebook":26,"pinterest":1,"total":68},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzdhL05vcnRoS29yZWFLLmY0NjRhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/d1cb48e2/b0b/North-Korea-Kim-Jong.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzdhL05vcnRoS29yZWFLLmY0NjRhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/51c15f07/b0b/North-Korea-Kim-Jong.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzdhL05vcnRoS29yZWFLLmY0NjRhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/e743014e/b0b/North-Korea-Kim-Jong.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzdhL05vcnRoS29yZWFLLmY0NjRhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/3a56d71c/b0b/North-Korea-Kim-Jong.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzdhL05vcnRoS29yZWFLLmY0NjRhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/96251353/b0b/North-Korea-Kim-Jong.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1tOjnbx","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"North Korea said Friday it has detained an American tourist for committing an unspecified crime, the third U.S. citizen being held there.","channel":"US & World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/us-world/"},{"_id":"5391d265b05f9d2a500008e4","id":"2014/06/06/students-take-down-gunman-seattle","title":"Police Credit Seattle Students for Gunman Takedown","title_tag":null,"author":"The Associated Press","post_date":"2014-06-06T14:38:20+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 06 Jun 2014 14:38:20 +0000","sort_key":"1wSVhG","link":"http://mashable.com/2014/06/06/students-take-down-gunman-seattle/","content":{"plain":"SEATTLE \u2014 Police credited students with the takedown of a lone gunman armed with a shotgun who entered a small Seattle university and starting firing at students. When the shooter stopped to reload, another student pepper-sprayed him and subdued him with the help of others, preventing more deaths, police said.\n\n\"There are a number of heroes in this,\" Assistant Police Chief Paul McDonagh said. \"The people around (the gunman) stepped up.\"\n\nA 19-year-old man was fatally shot and two other young people were wounded after the gunman entered the foyer at Otto Miller Hall on the Seattle Pacific University campus and started shooting Thursday afternoon. When he paused to reload, a student building monitor disarmed him. The gunman had additional rounds and a knife, McDonagh said.\n\n\"But for the great response by the people of Seattle Pacific, this incident might have been much more tragic,\" he said.\n\nThe man in custody was not a student at the school, McDonagh told a news conference.\n\nFour people, including the young man who died, were taken to Harborview Medical Center. A critically wounded 20-year-old woman remained in intensive care Friday, according to the hospital. A 24-year-old man was in satisfactory condition. A 22-year-old man injured in the struggled with the suspect was treated and released, officials said.\n\nNone of the victims was immediately identified.\n\nAaron R. Ybarra, 26, was booked into the King County Jail late Thursday for investigation of homicide, according to police and the jail roster.\n\nAlso late Thursday, police who said they were serving a warrant entered a house believed tied to Ybarra. A phone message left at that house in the north Seattle suburb of Mountlake Terrace was not immediately returned.\n\nMessages left with friends and relatives of Ybarra via social media were not immediately returned.\n\nThe Seattle Times reported that the suspect's father, Ambrose Ybarra, said he did not know anything about the shooting.\n\n\"We just hope he's safe,\" he told the newspaper. \"It's upsetting to have these accusations thrown around. We're in emergency mode. We are trying to stay calm.\"\n\nThe paper said Zack McKinley described himself as one of Ybarra's closest friends and said he was \"super happy and friendly.\"\n\nMcKinley said the attack was puzzling because Ybarra was happy to have just started a job bagging groceries at a store. Ybarra could get emotionally low, but McKinley said he had a good group of friends and never saw him depressed.\n\nStudent Chris Howard was at Otto Miller Hall when the shooting happened. He said he saw the wounded woman on the floor. Her phone was covered in blood, but she asked those helping her to look through her phone for her mother, aunt and best friend.\n\n\"She was panicking,\" Howard said. \"She said 'I think I'm going to die.'\"\n\nHoward said he also saw the suspect pinned on the floor.\n\n\"The suspect was calm. Not speaking. Not moving. Not struggling. Just there,\" Howard said.\n\nThe shooting came a week before the end of the school year.\n\nMcDonagh said detectives are working as quickly as they can to figure out the gunman's motive or intended target. He said it appears the suspect acted alone.\n\nThe university locked down its campus for several hours. Some students were taking finals in the building that the shooter entered.\n\nOn Thursday evening, an overflow crowd packed the First Free Methodist Church on campus for a service of prayers and song. The private Christian university cancelled classes Friday and planned to hold a service of \"prayer, lament and worship\" at noon.\n\n\"We're a community that relies on Jesus Christ for strength, and we'll need that at this point in time,\" said Daniel Martin, university president.\n\nThe school's 40-acre campus is in a leafy residential neighborhood about 10 minutes from downtown Seattle.\n\nJillian Smith was taking a math test on the second floor of Otto Miller Hall when a lockdown was ordered.\n\nShe heard police yelling and banging on doors in the hallway. The professor locked the classroom door the students lined up at the front of the classroom.\n\n\"We were pretty much freaking out,\" said Smith, 20, a sophomore.\n\nSmith said she saw bullet casings and what appeared to be blood on the lobby carpet and splatter on the wall as she left the building.\n\n\"Seeing blood made it real,\" Smith said. \"I didn't think something like this would happen at our school.\"\n\nThe gun violence follows a spate of recent shootings on or near college campuses.\n\nLast month, Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured seven before turning his gun on himself in a rampage in Isla Vista, California, near two universities, according to police.\n\nSeattle Mayor Ed Murray, noting previous mass shootings in the city, said: \"Once again the epidemic of gun violence has come to Seattle.\""},"shares":{"twitter":60,"facebook":6,"google_plus":1,"total":67},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzQ1L1NlYXR0bGVDYW1wLjE2YzFkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/a6591857/845/Seattle-Campus-Shooting.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzQ1L1NlYXR0bGVDYW1wLjE2YzFkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/cfccdea4/845/Seattle-Campus-Shooting.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzQ1L1NlYXR0bGVDYW1wLjE2YzFkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/a37baca2/845/Seattle-Campus-Shooting.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzQ1L1NlYXR0bGVDYW1wLjE2YzFkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/c1821e80/845/Seattle-Campus-Shooting.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA2LzA2LzQ1L1NlYXR0bGVDYW1wLjE2YzFkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/14586cb0/845/Seattle-Campus-Shooting.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1j6wa3O","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Police credited students with the takedown of a lone gunman armed with a shotgun who entered a small Seattle university and starting firing at students.

Backed by the support of parents and female game developers, Shabir started planning the camps and now she and LearnDistrict are set to host them in five cities, starting in San Francisco, for the next generation of female game developers.\n\nSee also: More Women Game Developers Means More Success, 'Animal Crossing' Director Says\n\nThe idea for the summer camps, which will start in mid June for girls aged 11-16, came to Shabir after she had trouble finding female hires for her games studio. Months spent searching for qualified female developers resulted in her questioning whether there were even any women interested in the gaming industry.\n\nAt Girls Make Games, the campers will learn about different genres of games and game development, with the LearnDistrict team introducing and explaining the unique challenges in certain game genres.\n\nThe girls will also tour Double Fine, a notable game development studio in San Francisco, and pitch their game ideas to a panel of judges from Double Fine, Google Play and USC.\n\nCurrently, around 48% of the general gaming population is female, according to the Entertainment Software Association's 2014 report. But only around 11% of the gaming industry's designers are women. For Shabir, that disparity in female representation is indicative of a self-sustained cycle within the games industry.\n\n\"The games that are being made appeal to boys, so boys play more and then they grow up making games,\" Shabir told Mashable. \"They\u2019re also the ones [that end up making] these 'girly' games for girls. It\u2019s a cycle that needs to break.\"\n\nShabir continued: \"College students have told me that it\u2019s so suffocating being in a classroom full of boys and that they need more voices to create more interesting projects. It makes for a better environment for everyone to have different opinions on different subjects.\"\n\nAs increasing interest -- especially among women and other underrepresented minorities -- in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects continue to dominate the U.S. education discussion, the need for women to continue to pursue careers in the gaming industry echoes that same need for STEM careers, especially in the male-dominated tech world. \n\nAccording to Shabir, by the third grade, young girls begin to lose interest in STEM subjects and by seventh grade, have given up completely on STEM careers because of gendered confidence gaps.\n\n\"Girls are extremely precocious around the elementary school age,\" said Shabir. \"They will raise their hands, they will answer questions, they will ask questions. They\u2019ll question everything, but as they get older, they stop and start accepting what society tells them because they\u2019re less confident.\"\n\nFor Shabir, that lack of confidence comes from the continued questioning a girl receives when she shows interest in pursuing a STEM career, an issue exacerbated in the gaming industry due to previously held stigmas about video games being a \"waste of time.\"\n\n\"Games are capable of educating a society,\" said Shabir. \"What television was to the 80s and 90s kids, that\u2019s what games are to kids growing up now. It\u2019s the medium to speak to them.\"\n\nThis summer Girls Make Games will host camps in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Austin and Boston. The first camp in San Francisco will start on June 16 and last three weeks. \n\nNext year, due to high interest, the summer camp will expand to cities like Washington, D.C., and possibly London and Cologne in Germany.\n\n\"It\u2019s one step at a time,\" said Shabir. \"I think we can do this and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m so happy to do this. I expected a really big fight to launch these workshops. But because there\u2019s so many other men and women who share my frustration that want to help, it\u2019s easier for me and more exciting. I\u2019m happy to lose sleep.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

All messages downloaded from our servers will be kept on your device until you log out, uninstall or update to a new version of Path.\n\nPath's announcement is particularly interesting because the app, which had 10 million users in 2013, was designed from the ground up to be a private social network exclusively for users' close friends and family. Injecting a privacy-centric feature into such a closed, trust-reliant social network suggests that Path is on the way toward removing the limit on the number of friends a user can have on the app (currently, the limit is 150 friends). \n\nThere were hints at such a move in March, when one prominent user posted a screenshot of a message from Path that detailed a user-increase test on the service. \n\nA feature made famous by Snapchat, Path's ephemeral-messaging announcement comes just one day after reports surfaced that dating app Tinder would be adding a similar feature. \n\nPerhaps even more significant, Apple announced on Monday that it had added ephemeral messaging to its Messages app for iOS 8, which is scheduled for public release this fall.\n\nWhat this all means for Snapchat, a company that reportedly turned down a $3-billion acquisition offer from Facebook last year, is unclear. But earlier this year, when asked about other apps adding ephemeral messaging, a Snapchat spokesperson told Mashable, \"It's exciting to see other companies begin to embrace deletion by default.\"\n\nAs more apps add ephemeral messaging to their toolboxes, the notion of Snapchat (and apps like it) as a mere product feature and not a full-fledged service is likely spreading among users and investors alike. Increasingly, Snapchat's multi-billion-dollar valuation is looking pretty ephemeral itself. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

The newspapers said these actions affected their distributions on Friday and Saturday, and accused the government of trying to stifle freedom of expression.\n\nSee also: Bring Back Our Girls: Why the World Is Finally Talking About Nigeria's Kidnapped Students\n\nThe Nation claimed that the soldiers stormed one of its distribution offices, under orders from the government.\n\n\"One of the military men told us that they were acting on [an] order from above as there were allegations that newspaper circulation vehicles were being used to smuggle arms and ammunition,\" one of The Nation's distribution managers said, according to Agence France-Press. \n\nThe military confirmed the operations, but argued that they were over \"security concerns,\" and not to stifle freedom of expression. The Nigerian government is under increasing pressure to respond to the Islamic militant group Boko Haram's actions around the country, and it's struggling to maintain order and peace. \n\nThe search \"followed intelligence report(s) indicating movement of materials with grave security implications across the country using the channel of newsprint-related consignments,\" Nigeria's defense spokesperson Chris Olukolade said, according to The Punch. \"The general public and the affected media organizations in particular are assured that the exercise was a routine security action and should not be misconstrued for any other motive.\"\n\nThe Punch, however, wrote that the government's actions were \"reminiscent of military dictatorship in the country.\" \n\nThe Daily Trust claimed that soldiers detained several drivers of its distribution van. The newspaper wrote that the military did not give \"any reason for its action,\" but noted that it had recently published an article that was critical of the military.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the Nigerian military's actions on Friday. \n\n\"Denying Nigerians access to news and information sows the seeds of rumors and distrust,\" Sue Valentine, CPJ's Africa program coordinator, said. \"While we recognize that Nigeria faces security threats, these can never effectively be addressed by media blackouts or persecution of journalists. We call on authorities to respect the vital role that media play in circulating information and holding government to account.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

They suffered the highest unemployment rates, which academic evidence\u00a0shows\u00a0this will permanently reduce their wages. In the meantime, student debt has skyrocketed to record levels. The result: Their greatest financial hardship may come decades from now, when they retire.\n\nMerrill Lynch released a\u00a0report\u00a0Wednesday intended to highlight the positive motivations for Americans working in retirement. The study found that 78% of pre-retirees above the age of 50 intend to work after they retire. Many are driven by reasons other than money. If these Boomers\u2014and future generations\u2014want to work in retirement, maybe the feared retirement crisis won\u2019t materialize.\n\nSee also: The Millennial's Guide to Personal Finance\n\nBut the report also provides a glimpse into the retirement expectations of successive generations, showing that the retirement crisis is still a major threat: Millennials are unprepared for retirement and they are counting on income sources that are unlikely to materialize. Merrill Lynch asked members of the past four generations (Silent, baby boomers, X and millennials) about their expected sources of retirement income. Each successive generation expects to depend less on Social Security and employer-provided pensions. Boomers, for instance, expect Social Security and employer-sponsored pensions to make up 60% of their retirement income. For millennials, it\u2019s only 28%:\n\nIn turn, millennials expect employment income and personal savings to make up 58% of their retirement income, compared to 35% for boomers and 20% for those in the Silent Generation. The Merrill Lynch report notes that life expectancy has increased significantly over the past few decades, rising from 75 years in 1990 to 78 in 2010. If people are living longer, conservatives often argue, then the retirement age should rise as well. But those gains have accrued entirely for the rich. Life expectancy for the bottom 50% of households has\u00a0barely changed\u00a0since 1977:\n\nIn other words, those who will have personal savings to fund their retirement are living longer, but those who won\u2019t have savings are not. Merrill Lynch did not break down their report by income level so we don\u2019t know how much low-income millennials intend to rely on employment income and personal savings in retirement. But since the entire millennial generation expects to depend heavily on employment income and personal savings, it\u2019s likely that low-income millennials intend to do so as well.\n\nBut what happens if those savings don\u2019t materialize in 30 years? A\u00a02013 Wells Fargo report\u00a0found that less than half of millennials are currently saving for retirement. If that rate does not increase, the millennial generation is counting on savings that won\u2019t exist.

Tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook are all toying with the idea of using them, and now they're a photographer's secret weapon. Drones are a big part of our lives, whether we see them or not. Drone Beat collects the best and most important stories every week.\n\nDrone Beat's coverage areas this week\n\nLast update: June 6, 5:44 p.m. ET\n\nUkraine tries to bring back its Soviet-era drones\r\nAs part of the effort to revamp its military, Ukraine is trying to resurrect some Soviet-era technology, including a giant spy drone: the Tupolev Tu-141 a reconnaissance drone that had its first flight in 1974. \n\nThe 47-foot-long Tu-141 can fly 20,000 feet high at more than 600 miles per hour, with a range of 600 miles, which makes it a decent surveillance drone. Given its age, however, it has some outdated features: it's launched from a trailer, it uses a tail-mounted parachute and retro rockets to descend to the ground and land, and its cameras are equipped with old-school film.\n\nBut as the Medium blog War is Boring notes: \"Just because the drone is old, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t useful.\"\n\nAt this point it's unclear how many of these drones Ukraine actually has. The Soviet Union only produced 152, and Ukraine absorbed several after the end of the cold war, according to War is Boring.\n\nKenya and South Africa ban drones\n\nTwo African governments have banned the private and commercial use of drones due to safety concerns, delivering a major blow to programs that had intended to use the flying robots to stop illegal wildlife poaching.\n\nThe Kenyan government announced the ban at the end of May, while South Africa's did so this week.\n\nMany groups have started testing drones  around the world as a cheap and effective way to fight rhino and elephant poachers. In Kenya in particular, the Ol Pejeta conservancy wanted to use the $70,000 \"Aerial Ranger\" drone sold by American company Airware to monitor illegal hunters in the 90,000-acre fenced-off reserve of El Pejeta, in the country's Laikipia District. \n\nBut these bans effectively shut down these programs, putting them in danger of disappearing and, perhaps, even putting some animals in even more in danger. \n\n7 film companies asks for permission to use drones\n\nIn the U.S., technically, no one can legally fly drones for commercial purposes. But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced this week that it's considering making an exception to the rule after seven movie and TV production companies asked for permission to use flying robots.\n\nThe FAA notes that if they decide to grant the exemption, there \"could be tangible economic benefits\" for the companies. But the reality, as Motherboard points out, is that Hollywood has already been using drones for years. Sometimes, they film outside the U.S. to avoid any legal trouble, other times they just ignore the rules. This request, in other words, doesn't really change the status quo.\n\nLAPD gets free drones from Seattle\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department became the largest law enforcement agency to have drones -- at least that we know of -- after acquiring two Draganflyer X6 drones last week. \n\nAs it turns out, these small hexacopter surveillance drones were actually a gift of the Seattle police, which had to dump the drones after public and privacy advocates forced the police to ground its drone program. Perhaps to avoid a similar situation, the LAPD took pains to clarify that it won't unleash the drones in the skies of Los Angeles to spy on its citizens, but will only use them for \"narrow and prescribed uses.\"\n\n\"We wanted to be really up-front with the public that we're looking at using these down the road,\" LAPD spokesman Andrew Smith said. \"We wanted to make sure it didn't look like we were trying to sneak these things into action.\"\n\nYou can see a Draganflyer X6 in action in the video below.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

But the show, as it has already done so effectively this season through character flashbacks for Crazy Eyes and Taystee, continues to flourish when it puts the supporting cast under the microscope, giving us deeper looks into each particular inmate's backstory.\n\nSee also: 'Orange Is the New Black' Episodes 1-3 Recaps: Lies Can Be Deceiving\r\nEPISODE 4: \"A Whole Other Hole\"\n\nThis episode begins and ends on the lovelorn Lorna Morello, with flashbacks in between that expose the reason she's in prison and the heartbreaking truth behind her wedding-planning obsession. The twist? Her \"fiance\" Christopher was never her fiance ever. Chris is real, but she imagined their relationship in her deranged pursuit for a dream man.\n\n\"A Whole Other Hole\" opens with Morello waking up and removing hair rollers made out of toilet paper from her head. It appears she's starting to recover from the devastating news she learned earlier this season. Chris has moved on and found a new woman to marry, to which Morello tearfully reacted in Episode 3 with one of the season's best lines: \"He doesn\u2019t realize she's a whore. You don't go Jessica Simpson when you've got Rihanna.\"\n\nDespite knowing the relationship is over for good, yet still in denial, Morello tells correctional officer Susan Fischer that she has pushed the \"pause button\" on wedding plans. Together, the two women drive a cancer-ridden inmate to chemotherapy. Upon arrival, Fischer demands Morello wait in the parking lot alone for three hours. Morello then gets the crazy idea to spend that time going to Chris' house. She breaks in through a back door, cries at the sight of their engagement photos and wedding invitations, puts on the Chris' finacee's wedding veil and hops into a bubble bath with it still on. She falls asleep.\n\nIt's humanizing, private moments like Morello's breakdown that have OITNB viewers crying and laughing with the characters all season long.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Litchfield prison, the inmates discuss the female anatomy, thus explaining the name of Episode 4. Poussey, touting an invention that allows her to urinate standing up, gets the conversation going. Sophia, played by transgendered actress Laverne Cox (who recently graced the cover of Time magazine to represent the trans movement), sets the record straight with a well-educated lesson on female parts.\n\nSex talk gets dirty when Big Boo discovers Nicky's journal of sexcapades. \"I collect vaginas,\" Nicky proclaims, inciting Big Boo and her to launch into a game of who can have the most sex. Big Boo pursues new inmate Brooke Soso, with Piper's help, but in the end, it's Nicky who gets with the talkative newbie.\n\nAfter catching Taystee cuddling with best friend Poussey, the conniving Vee warns Taystee to avoid the \"gay\" interactions with Poussey. Vee is doing this to punish Poussey for denying joining forces on a contraband business.\n\nPiper gets reassigned to a bunk with disgraced prison chef Red, who hasn't had a bunkmate for 12 years. Red tells her to not move her stuff. Piper does it anyway and says, \"What are you going to do? Not feed me?\" Red, who lost power of the prison kitchen in Season 1, looks defeated. Eventually, the two make amends and bond, with Red offering words of wisdom: \"People are fickle \u00a0\u2026 You have to be selfish in here. That\u2019s how you survive. Loyalty means nothing.\" Red makes friends with the older \"invisible\" inmates and decides to resurrect the greenhouse to give them all a new hobby.\n\nIt seems as though Vee and Red are rounding up allies, likely for their own selfish reasons because they're hellbent on regaining the power they once had.\n\nAmid all this, the episode kept the focus on Morello. Flashbacks reveal her materialistic past and the mail scam she orchestrated to fuel her criminal fashion needs. We see the first time she met Chris, who looks like a dream guy from a magazine page she had plastered in her bedroom wall. The most-telling flashback, however, is the one of Chris in court testifying that he only ever went on one coffee date with Morello before losing interest. Her obsession for him never wavered, though, and he eventually had to get a restraining order. She once put an explosive under a car to try and get revenge.\n\nThe flashback ends with Morello waking up in the bubble bath as Chris comes home. She hops out of a window before he finds her and drives back to chemotherapy.\n\nStill reeling from almost being caught, Morello cries at movie night. Yoga Jones asks if she's OK. Morello, having spun lies about her fictitious fiance during her entire stint in prison, continues her fake fairy tale and says she misses Chris.\n\n\"We\u2019ll be married. We\u2019ll be married,\" Morello says.\r\nEPISODE 5 -- \"Low Self Esteem City\"\n\nThe self-segregated prison groups, separated primarily by race, butt heads after plumbing in the \"Spanish Harlem\" bathroom malfunctions and regurgitates sewage into the showers. Head chef Gloria brings her group into the \"black\" bathroom to shower there, but new group leader Vee tells Gloria and her girls to take a hike.\n\nUnwavering, Gloria wins this battle, sparking an all-out war that persists throughout the episode. Vee's ladies steal their enemies' shoes and tie the shoestrings together, making Gloria's gang late for kitchen duties. To retaliate, they spoil the food that day with an excessive amount of salt. A displeased Watson sticks her foot out and trips secretly pregnant kitchen crew member Daya, who falls to the ground. Prison Guard John Bennett, the father of Daya's unborn child, throws Watson on the ground and punishes her.\n\nWhile the war intensifies, the show sprinkles in flashbacks of Gloria's abusive pre-prison relationship with her boyfriend. In one scene, he slaps her while she's on the job at a convenience store. In another, she has a black eye and contemplates leaving him but doesn't. Gloria reveals to her friend that she's been stealing people's food stamp money, and putting the funds in a wooden box under the register, to make a living. She lands in prison after a disgruntled customer turns her in to police.\n\nGloria confronts Vee, pulling her into the bathroom to warn her not to mess with the women under her wing. Vee, always the manipulative one, fakes her way through a watery-eyed excuse that she's getting too old to fight and too weak to pretend she's the glue holding her newly acquired group together. They make a deal: Gloria can have the working showers in exchange for letting two of Vee's girls start working in the kitchen. Red, who is busy reviving the greenhouse, hears the news and storms into the kitchen to talk to Gloria. Vee \"played you,\" Red says. \"You have no idea what you\u2019ve done.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nicky and Big Boo's contest to have sexual encounters with the most prison occupants rages on, with Nicky calling herself \"a sexual Steve Jobs.\"\n\nPiper learns her grandmother is gravely ill. She asks corrections officer Sam Healy, who isn't fond of her and let her almost die in Season 1, if she can have furlough in order to say goodbye to her grandma. He initially says no, but after having a change of heart because of his fractured relationship with his Ukrainian mail-order bride and lack of friends, he tells Piper he will try to make the furlough happen.\n\nPiper calls her ex, Larry, who gushes that he misses her as a tear rolls down her face.\n\nIn the kitchen, Gloria lights a religious candle and then puts out the flame before the episode's final flashback takes us back to the convenience store where her boyfriend steals the wooden box of money but forgets his keys on the counter. He goes to the store's back room, accidentally knocks over a lit candle and starts a fire. Locked in without keys, he dies.\r\nEPISODE 6 -- \"You Also Have a Pizza\"\n\nIt's Valentine's Day at Litchfield, and it's hard to find love in the air. Piper says that love is \"like coming home after a long trip.\" Maritza, who ran for prison government last season using the slogan \"If you want more pizza, vote for Maritza,\" describes love as having \"pizza\" together. Sophia says love is pain, the kind you want to feel over and over again.\n\nThe episode explores a different kind of pain, though, via flashbacks to Poussey's life in Germany, where she fell in love with a German-speaking lady. Their love is cut short when the German woman's homophobic, military father catches the couple naked in bed. The dad reassigns Poussey's family, forcing them to move back to America so Poussey's relationship will end. None too happy with the outcome, Poussey angrily approaches her lover's father. She almost shoots him, but Poussey's own dad intervenes before she can even pull out her gun.\n\nIt feels like a similar type of heartbreak, though to a lesser intimate extant, that Poussey is experiencing with Taystee, Vee continues to try and tear the two best friends apart.\u00a0By the end of the episode, Vee's plans hit a boiling point, as Poussey and Taystee yell at each other at the Valentine's Day party. Poussey is now as an outsider in Vee's group.\n\nDaya and Bennett pretend to be a normal couple in the kitchen, scheming on how to make their holiday a special one despite having to keep their love and pregnancy secret. They eventually have sex in warden's assistant Joe Caputo's office. Daya's imprisoned mother and other inmates begin to use Bennett to smuggle in items in his prosthetic leg.\n\nLarry comes to visit Piper, asking her to help him as a journalist to expose the prison's misuse of funds. She gets mad and calls him the moon. He spits back by calling her the sun: \"At least people can walk on the moon. Anyone gets near the sun they just burn right up.\u201d\n\nPiper has second thoughts about Larry's request. Piper starts to investigate where the money is going in the prison. Corrections officer Healy catches her asking guard Lolita Foster why a planned gym was never built. Piper, needing a reason to explain her incessant questions, weasels out of the situation by saying she wants to start a prison newsletter. Healy believes her, and Piper may have a way to get back on Larry's good graces.\n\nLarry, who has been filling his time by hanging out with Piper's married best friend Polly Harper, kisses Polly.

But it was California Chrome's run we were watching, and the 4-5 favorite finished a close fourth. \n\nSEE ALSO:\u00a0Rooting for California Chrome's Triple Crown Win Is Almost Too Easy\n\nThe horse from dusty north-central California and humble heritage would've been the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978, and the first California horse in history to win one. He also would've ended the event's longest drought in history, which just got one year longer.\n\nChrome started clean and glided over to the rail out of the gate, but traffic started to build around his right flank early.\u00a0Jockey Victor Espinoza stayed in the stirrups for most of the backstretch, saving some of the chestnut-colored three-year-old's blazing speed for the end. \n\nBy the time Espinoza released, the three-wide lead horses sealed him off. With the race more than half over, Espinoza was forced to try his horse's waning luck on the outside of the front pack.\n\nCalifornia Chrome caught up to the leaders, going four-wide even as he took the long way around the final turn. Looking like he might have a chance, Espinoza got on the whip -- but on the final stretch his horse flagged ever so slightly, the compounded wear of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness in the weeks before.\n\nThat wear and tear also had California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn sowing sour grapes. He complained immediately after the race that some of the competing horses, which didn't run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness, had been entered just to knock out his underdog bid with the horse from nowhere.\n\n\"It's all or nothing,\" he said to a live television feed. \"This is not fair to these horses and to the people that believe in them. This is the coward's way out.\"\n\nIt was a comment directed at Tonalist, whose last start was May 10 at the Belmont track, and hadn't raced before that since March. But that's exactly why the Triple Crown has become one of the rarest and most difficult achievements in sports. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

Although sidling up to a caf\u00e9 in Europe or North America and grabbing a bit of free Wi-Fi for your mobile device is common, finding such wireless access in tech-centric Japan's major cities remains notoriously difficult. But that's about to change. \n\nSee also: Google Street View Says Japan Is Top Virtual Tourism Spot in Asia\n\nA new program launched by NTT (Japan's largest telecom), is designed to serve foreign tourists on the hunt for Wi-Fi. For those who haven't traveled to Japan, the program might seem behind the times, but for anyone familiar with attempting to find Wi-Fi in Japan, this is huge news. (YouTube is littered with video commentary from frustrated travelers marveling at the lack of Wi-Fi access in such a technologically advanced country as Japan.) \n\nNow, when a traveler arrives at a Japanese airport, they can present their passport and register for a Wi-Fi card that offers free Wi-Fi coverage via 45,000 hot spots in the eastern Japan area including Tokyo, Hakone, Mt. Fuji, Yokohama, Nagano, Nikko, Kusatsu, Tohoku, Hokkaido and Fukushima. \n\nAdditionally, a traveler outside of the country preparing to visit Japan can download the iOS or Android version of the NAVITIME for Japan Travel app and obtain an ID and password beforehand. The app also offers an augmented reality mode that shows you a Street View-style image of the location where an available Wi-Fi hotspot is located.\n\nHowever, the access only lasts for 14 days (or 336 hours), just enough to get you used to the free access, but not long enough to be truly useful for anyone planning an extended stay in Japan.  \n\nAccording to the Nikkei, the program is also being directed by the Japanese government, which plans to use the initiative to get more buildings in the country to offer Wi-Fi access. \n\nThe trial program, which began earlier this year, will last until September 2014. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

Because you won\u2019t remember what made this year great until someone on Reddit writes about it ten or twenty years from now and you think to yourself, \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s when laptops became awesome.\u201d Finally.\n\nSee also: 10 Things You Didn't Know Dropbox Could Do\n\nIn my nearly eight years of writing about technology and 20+ revolutions around our little sun playing with tech, this is the first time when mobile computing hasn\u2019t sucked. In fact, it\u2019s a joy! And the new Razer Blade is the epitome of excellence in mobile computing: kickass desktop-level performance, over six hours of battery life, a gorgeous display, all in a thin clamshell design that's lick-worthy. Come and get it.\n\nRefinement, minus the screen\n\nIf you think the Blade looks a lot like the MacBook Pro Retina, you're right. Last year's model was a success, and aside from some fine tuning, almost nothing has changed. The keyboard is tighter with excellent low-profile keys; the trackpad is smooth and for some reason still includes two physical buttons and no multi-touch right click; and the speakers produce soft, high-quality audio for movies, music, and of course, games.\n\nThe big update is a vastly improved 3K monitor. This Blade has a 3,200 x 1,800 pixel resolution display, the highest I\u2019ve ever seen on any monitor less than double the size. And that\u2019s a problem.\n\n4K (3,840 x 2,160) content may be all the rage nowadays, but unless you're watching House of Cards, there's no content. 3K? It doesn't even exist, and it never will. 1080p video content doesn't fit right, and neither does 4K. The only exception is games, which can almost always fit to the screen's native resolution. Windows doesn't even look good on it; everything's too small. \n\nYet the display is so gorgeous, so well made, that almost anything looks spectacular on it. 720p video content is fuzzy, but 1080p video looks great, and if you set the screen for other high resolutions like 2,048 x 1,152, the video quality is still excellent. This is one of the best laptop monitors I\u2019ve ever tested, one that produces excellent color and light contrast, is bright enough for outdoor use even with a glossy display, and it\u2019s a touchscreen to boot. It looks so good at other resolutions that even if you never use the native 3K, every other widescreen resolution looks great. \n\nPerformance? Let slip the dogs of war\n\nFor a 14-inch laptop, the Blade is the fastest, highest-performance machine I\u2019ve ever tested of its size. It boasts some incredible specs: a quad-core 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 4702HQ, 8GB of RAM, and the all new NVIDIA GTX 870M with 3GB of video RAM. The Blade supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi, the fastest wireless technology, and the whole thing ships with 128/256/512GB of memory. The pre-production test unit Razer provided shipped with 128GB and retails for $2,200.\n\nThis machine was built for speed, and every part pushes the envelope. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re just browsing the web or playing Metro: Last Light in its native Russian, the Blade gets the job done fast. And it\u2019ll last over six hours on the battery when word processing or web browsing. Gaming battery life isn't so hot, lasting just about an hour. \n\nThe Blade gets hot and while it\u2019ll run many games extremely well when plugged in, it does throttle performance when on the battery. That means what\u2019ll typically run at a steady 30 frames per second when plugged in will be unplayable on the battery, though with the right settings the Blade will run just about any of today\u2019s top games and still look stunning.\n\nStill, this laptop barely lasts over an hour for Batman: Origins and Crysis 3 while maintaining a solid 30 fps. Plug it in, and you\u2019ll get noticeably better performance, and no longer fear losing another game save.\n\nUltraHD gaming is the future... and it\u2019s not ready for mobile\n\nThere\u2019s only one place the Blade slips, and that\u2019s at high resolution. Throw any game up at 3K and everything slows down. Adding more pixels on the screen is the most punishing task for the graphics processor, and it shows. The Blade can play every single game I threw at it at 1,600 x 900 with every graphical option set to maximum. At 3K, everything must be cut in half, and even then performance is always noticeably worse.\n\nSo yes, 3K gaming is possible on the Blade, but it isn\u2019t worth it. That\u2019s not to say that ultra-high-definition gaming isn\u2019t better, because it absolutely is. Photorealistic games like Assassin\u2019s Creed IV: Black Flag look ridiculously good at higher resolutions, but not if you have to turn off all of the settings that make it look so damn pretty.\n\nAs powerful as the Blade is, it cannot handle 4K/UltraHD gaming. Not in the way anyone would want to play, and certainly not in a reasonable way for a laptop. And if you thought 3K performance had limitations, 4K is just even harder to stomach. I tested the Blade with the Samsung U28D590D Ultra-HD 4K monitor and every single game ran better than on MSI\u2019s GS60 Ghost, but not enough to warrant using those extra pixels.\n\nBlade running\n\nThe Razer Blade isn\u2019t a desktop replacement -- it\u2019s a mobile desktop. If I owned one, I\u2019d replace my desktop for it because it\u2019s so damn powerful, and it just so happens to fit very comfortably in practically any bag. Every other computer you can own is secondary. The Blade is a refined, beautiful laptop that is an absolute joy to use for everything from typing this review to hours of gaming. \n\nAs great as the Blade is, it\u2019s a bit too ambitious. The 3K display produces excellent picture quality and is very bright, but it\u2019s more than the laptop can handle. And all that power comes at a high price. $2,200 is expensive, and that\u2019s for just 128GB of memory, barely enough for a few games. It\u2019s not worthwhile without at least 256GB, which costs $2,400; 512GB sells for $2,700.

I don\u2019t want revenge. I want peace,\u201d he said, prompting a standing ovation by Ukrainian officials and dozens of foreign dignitaries.\n\nIn a show of support, a delegation from the United States led by Vice President Joe Biden observed Poroshenko\u2019s inauguration. The group also included Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, senators John McCain, Chris Murphy and Ron Johnson, and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt.\n\nEuropean Union President Herman Van Rompuy also attended.\r\nAwkward. Ukrainian solder staggers, drops his rifle as #Poroshenko passes by before entering the Verkhovna Rada. http://t.co/KKORBeOyhX\u2014 Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) June 7, 2014\n\nPoroshenko also pledged to hold early local elections in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the hard-knuckled industrial territories in the east collectively known as the Donbass, to seek a solution to the deepening crisis that has cost the lives of more than 200 Ukrainians, including at least 61 servicemen.\n\n\u201cWe need a legitimate partner for dialogue today. We won\u2019t talk with murders, and we are ready to call early local elections in Donbass to form partners for dialogue,\u201d he said, adding that he plans soon \u201cto go to the east of the country with peace.\u201d\n\nSwitching from speaking Ukrainian to Russian, Poroshenko addressed people in Donetsk and Luhansk directly. \u201cWhat will I bring with me as president when I visit you in the near future? Peace,\u201d he said.\n\nOf the many challenges facing Poroshenko, none are more sizable than curbing the deadly violence in eastern Ukraine and returning peace to the restive regions.\n\nThe day before he took the oath of office, gunfights continued to rage in Slovainsk, the heart of the separatist insurgency, where rebels used MANPADS to down an An-26 plane carrying humanitarian aid to locals, according to Vladislav Seleznev, a spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s anti-terrorist operation underway in eastern Ukraine. \n\nHe said that three Ukrainian troops were killed when the plane was hit and downed, while at least three more suffered injuries and are being treated in a hospital. Two more pilots were still missing. Some managed to parachute to safety as pilots steered the flaming plane away from a densely populated residential area of Sloviansk into a pastoral location outside the city.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Ukrainian army shelled nearby Semenivka, where dozens of heavily armed rebels had been holed up. The rocket attack left the town in shambles.\n\nWhile Ukraine officials have pointed to gains in the military operation \u2013- like the retaking of the Donetsk airport after it was seized by rebel gunmen -\u2013 it has been largely unsuccessful. In fact, the insurgents gained ground this week, seizing bases of Ukraine\u2019s National Guard and State Border Service in Luhansk region, as well as a border crossing that can now be used as a corridor to funnel reinforcements and weapons from Russia.\n\nThe president promised in the days leading up to his inauguration to work to end the bloodshed and separatism in the east \u201cin hours, not weeks.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Friday praised Poroshenko for his willingness \u201cto immediately stop bloodshed in eastern Ukraine\u201d after the two chatted briefly in an impromptu one-minute meeting during D-Day commemoration events in France.\n\nRemarking on the encounter, Putin said that it was not Russia\u2019s place to step in a halt the fighting, since it \u201cis not a party to the conflict, but the Kiev authorities and the federalization supporters in the east.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you for sure how this all is going to be implemented and how this all is going to be formalized, but [Poroshenko\u2019s] determination in general looked right to me, and I liked it. I hope the things will go exactly this way, and if this happens, then conditions will also be provided for the development of our relations in other fields, including the economy,\u201d Putin said.\n\nOne option being considered by Ukraine appears to be declaring a state of emergency, or martial law, to bring the eastern regions under Kiev\u2019s control. Poroshenko and his team have been tight lipped on any plans to do so, but security officials told the Kyiv Post on June 5 that the now-former interim President Oleksandr Turchynov had already ordered the country\u2019s security services to prepare proposals.\n\nImposing a state of emergency, or martial law in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts would allow for Ukraine to close its border with Russia and evacuate the local population before ramping up its anti-terrorist operation. It could allow for the introduction of curfews, food rationing and limitations on travel for local residents. Most importantly, it would help authorities to coordinate all agencies participating in Ukraine\u2019s anti-terrorism operation.\n\nBut before that happens, it appears as though Poroshenko will extend a final olive branch to separatist fighters there.\r\n#Poroshenko: #Ukraine will pursue visa-free regime with Europe, and then will strive for \"full membership in the European Union.\"\u2014 Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) June 7, 2014\n\nIn his Saturday speech in parliament, he said he would work to decentralize power in Ukraine, placing more of it in the hands of regional governments, and guarantee free use of the Russian language. He stopped short, however, of saying the federalization of Ukraine would be considered, something Russia has asked for, and that he would grant the Russian language official status. That, he said, would be reserved only for Ukrainian.\n\nAs part of his peace deal, Russian mercenaries fighting among Ukrainians in the east would be allowed safe passage back to Russia and an amnesty would be granted to those who did not kill servicemen or civilians in fighting, or finance \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nSeparatist leaders, however, have repeatedly said that no negotiations are possible until Ukraine pulls its troops out of the regions.\n\nOlexiy Haran, a political analyst and professor of political science at Kyiv Mohyla Academy, described the new president\u2019s inaugural speech as \u201cvery strong \u2013 stronger than I had expected.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Poroshenko\u2019s speech], was very clear, and there was no diplomatic maneuvering. He spoke with a strong voice and delivered strong messages about territorial integrity, unity of the country, and what he said, that he is not going to change the balance of power, this is very important,\u201d Haran told Mashable.\n\nAlso, Haran said, \u201cIt was symbolic that he switched to Russian when addressing people in eastern Ukraine. They will like that out there.\u201d\n\nStill, he added, Poroshenko has his work cut out for him.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

But according to experts, the patent isn't exactly what it seems and shouldn't have as much of a profound impact on photographers as they think.\n\nThe news of the patent win first surfaced about two weeks ago, and the resulting uproar focused on supposed ownership of a basic technique. Technically, it could mean Amazon has license to sue anyone shooting a catalog.\n\nSee also: The 18 Most Important Features in iOS 8\n\nNot surprisingly, photographers are not happy. In fact, there's already a petition circulating with nearly 45,000 signatures asking the US Patent and Trademark Office to appeal the parent.\n\n\"It's an abuse of copyright and a mockery of the patent system \u2014 and we're calling on the USPT Office to declare the reasoning for the patent invalid and get rid of this exercise in ego now,\" the petition description reads on Watchdog.net. \"We don't know if Amazon is about to start sending demand letters to photo studies [sic] or if it just wanted to be able to say that a photography 101 trick that been used for decades is something it thought up.\"\n\nBut Doug Manchee, Professor of Advertising Photography at Rochester Institute of Technology, believes some photographers are overreacting because they don't understand what the patent prohibits.\n\n\"Amazon does not have a patent to shoot on a background; rather, the patent is for the particular set up in their studio that involves certain types of lenses, cameras and lighting,\" Manchee told Mashable.\n\n\u201cAmazon can\u2019t patent shooting on a white background because it didn\u2019t invent that technique,\u201d he said. \u201cThe patent is for a specific way to shoot, and that is why the photo community is both amused and confused by this: it\u2019s just not enforceable.\u201d\n\nIn fact, if Amazon were to serve up legal papers to a photographer for copying their method, it would have to go to great lengths to do so. Sure, the company could request the original file -- which stores information like shutter speed and camera model -- but there\u2019s no data on the lighting.\n\n\u201cNobody knows why Amazon did this -- and why they would even want to -- and we\u2019re all just scratching our heads,\u201d Manchee added.\n\nManchee believes the patent won\u2019t actually affect how photographers shoot in the future.\n\n\u201cSome photographers are overreacting because they don\u2019t know the specifics,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople shoot against a white background thousands of times a day -- e-commerce is based on this method -- but because Amazon didn\u2019t come up with it, photographers can still proceed. You could always adjust the shutter speed by just a little.\u201d\n\nThe patent specifies lights should be placed in certain positions and are modified by attachments to those lights. If a photographer were to move one of the lights a foot or two in any direction, a person wouldn\u2019t be in violation of the patent.\n\nSouth Dakota-based Chris Reistroffer, who has been shooting for 15 years, is among the photographers who signed the petition and is upset about the patent ruling.\n\n\"I hope this doesn't open up the opportunity for other companies to trademark other common photography methods,\" Reistroffer said. \"If another company puts a patent on a black border or a '50s style photo against a certain background, it could eventually affect creativity. It's a dangerous slope.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

First Class Greg Williams told The Associated Press.\n\nSee also: Tracy Morgan Answers the Internet's Call and Joins Twitter \n\nMorgan is in intensive care at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey, according to a hospital spokesperson. \n\nMorgan's family is with him at the hospital, according to the actor's representative. \"His family is now with him and he is receiving excellent care,\" Lewis Kay said in a statement. \"We don't anticipate much of a change in his condition today, but will provide a further update once more information becomes available.\"\n\nJames McNair, 63, a passenger on the limo bus died in the wreck. \n\nMorgan was also traveling with his assistant Jeffrey Millea and comedian Ardie Fuqua, who were in critical condition at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

The driver of the tractor-trailer apparently failed to notice slow traffic ahead, swerved at the last minute in an attempt to avoid hitting Morgan's limo bus, but crashed into it. \n\nThe crash caused a chain-reaction accident that also involved a second tractor-trailer, an SUV and two cars. \n\nMorgan performed in Dover, Delaware on Friday night as part of his Turn it Funny tour. Comedian Fuqua, who opened for Morgan, posted an Instagram picture from the show early Saturday before the accident.\n\nThe 45-year-old Bronx native joined Saturday Night Live in 1996, and was on the sketch-comedy program for seven years before leaving to star in The Tracy Morgan Show in 2003; it lasted just one season.
